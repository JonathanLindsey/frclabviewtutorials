### Thank you

First, let me (mshafer1 - site Curator) say "Thank you." for being willing to share your knowledge with the rest of the FRC community.

I am posting this article for new writers to have an easy reference on how to format their pages and submit them.

### Creating the markdown

One can use 
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/){:target="_blank"} or 
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} to create a basic markdown file (Visual Studio Code even has a preview option) or
* Another option is to use an online markdown editor like [this free one](https://markdownlivepreview.com/){:target="_blank"} and download the resulting source (If using this method, please adjust the image and file links before submitting - see section below.)


### Formatting Specs

* Please put a written by [Team Number] with a logo or something on the bottom.
* Header 1 and 2 are used in the setup for the page, so use Header 3 and smaller for section labels within the document.
* Don't worry about the exact path to the css file or the menu or other header items - when I move build it with jekyll, the template will take care of those things.
* To keep architecture consistent, please put any and all images in a folder named images next to your markdown file (i.e. paths should look like src="images/example.jpeg"), and downloadable files should be linked with href="files/example.vi" (which means that any attached vi's and the like should be put in a folder named files next to the markdown file). You will need to make sure to include these files when submitting.

### Submitting for Review,

* Option1 - email
	<br/>
	You can email me your draf at [curator@frclabviewtutorials.com](mailto:curator@frclabviewtutorials.com). Once I have what I need to format your page, I will post it for peer review to the admin group.
* Option2 - Github Pull request
	<br/>
	Now that the site is hosted on Github, you can fork the repo ([Github Repo link](https://github.com/mshafer1/frclabviewtutorials){:target="_blank"}), make your changes, and post a pull request to have your changes merged into the master branch (this will start the peer-review process).
