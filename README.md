## Purpose
This website was created for the express purpose of posting informative tutorials on the FRC control system programmed in LabVIEW.  It is not intended to duplicate existing getting started guides, but to compliment them.

Some of the good ones we are aware of are here: 
* [WPI Getting Started](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13811)
* [Team 358's](http://www.team358.org/files/programming/ControlSystem2015-2019/labview/index.php)
* Others? (Let us know in the [contact us](/contact) page!)

## Please Note

Some pictures on this website are vi snippets - pictures created by LabVIEW that can be put back in LabVIEW and they become code again - those that are, will download when clicked on or can be dragged to a local folder (like the desktop), then dragged into LabVIEW.
